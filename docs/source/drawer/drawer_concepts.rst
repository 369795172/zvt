Drawer concepts
===============


Intent
------------------------------
There are many kinds of charts, but the intent is much less. zvt classify
intent as change, distribute, composite and compare.

We could analyze the entity itself or look at it in the whole market by
comparing with others. :ref:`NormalData<factor.normal_data>` uses
different structure to express different intent.

one entity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


multiple entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* compare


Drawer
------------------------------
Drawer is who can draw the picture with NormalData by Intent.
